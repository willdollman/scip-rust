# scip-rust

## Hello World

Welcome to scip-rust! This tool helps you generate SCIP (SCIP Code Intelligence Protocol) data for Rust codebases.

## About

At the moment, this is just a tiny wrapper around `rust-analyzer` to generate SCIP data,
with the configuration set up for use by Sourcegraph.

If you want to upload LSIF to Sourcegraph.com in CI, check out
[lsif-rust-action](https://github.com/sourcegraph/lsif-rust-action) instead.
